# SPT FIKA Headless Client Manager

Small web app in Blazor to manage SPT FIKA headless clients that I made for me and my friends to use.

## What does it do?

It monitors the headless clients described in the `appsettings.json` file and displays the following statuses:
- Stopped
- Running
- Loading
- Starting

When a Headless Client is `Stopped`, you can click `Start` to start the instance.
When a Headless Client is `Running`, you can click `Restart` to restart the headless client instance.

## Screenshots please?

Sure
