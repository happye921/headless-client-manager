# SPT FIKA Headless Client Manager

Small web app in Blazor to manage SPT FIKA headless clients that I made for me and my friends to use.

## What does it do?

It monitors the headless clients described in the `appsettings.json` file and displays the following statuses:
- Stopped
- Running
- Loading
- Starting

When a Headless Client is `Stopped`, you can click `Start` to start the instance.
When a Headless Client is `Running`, you can click `Restart` to restart the headless client instance.

## Screenshots please?

Sure

## Can anyone use this?

> [!WARNING]
> Yes, but be advised that I made this for personal use and accomodated it to my personal use cases, I'm not responsible for any side effects.

## How can I use this?
You can either build it with any .NET 9 build tool or download a [Release Package](https://github.com/happye921/headless-client-manager/releases) and host it on whatever platform you like that supports .NET 9 applications.
If you're on Windows, I recommend using IIS, just keep in mind that **you have to install** the [ASP.NET Core Runtime 9 HOSTING BUNDLE](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-aspnetcore-9.0.10-windows-hosting-bundle-installer).

## Can I contribute?

Be my guest.

## Can I steal this?

Be my guest.
